# TA-Pagination

An content pagination solution which is 100% customizable and has endless animation options. If you already use Tailwind CSS and Alpine JS in your project you might consider using TA-Pagination. If you are aware of speed loading then you can use the lazy loading feature so you can keep you web page speed high.

Use TA-Pagination as a part of your Tailwind CSS and Alpine JS project. You can use it as a stand alone version but it works best together with your own scripts and enhancements. The content and article pagination is designed to fit in every project, in every grid and in every flexbox design.
